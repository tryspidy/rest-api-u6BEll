1) REQUEST
2) RESPONSE
When we send request, we need to know the API
methods/endpoints that are available:
		- read documentation about API methods.
		- Swagger tool, that has API methods and descriptions
simple endpoint:
		â€¦school.com/api/students
Types of Requests:
	GET -> Read data
	POST -> Create/insert data
	PUT -> Update data
	DELETE-> Delete data
I send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE type of API requests to
API endpoint/method and get response.
